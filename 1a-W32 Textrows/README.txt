Assignment 1 - Win32API – simple window with text & graphics

For this assignment, you MUST use MS Visual Studio Premier 2013 from the MS Dreamspark download site. (It’s free). This version of VS contains the wizards for ALL of the MS assignments in this course.
Using the sample program to get you started, create a window that:
1.	When opened, displays a message with your name in it, like “Hello from Joe” (but use your own name, of course).
2.	When the mouse is clicked, adds a line of text below the “hello” line, which MUST still be shown.
a.	This new line will be in a different color & typeface than the 1st line. All subsequent lines may be in any font, style & color.
b.	Ensures that all previous lines & text are not erased when adding any new line
3.	Allow the user to repeat step 2 as many times as the user desires.

Do proper program cleanup (“new” storage must be “deleted”, etc.).
